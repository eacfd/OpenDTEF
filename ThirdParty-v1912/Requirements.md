## OpenFOAM&reg; ThirdParty System Requirements

For building some particular third-party libraries from source,
the normal [OpenFOAM System Requirements][link openfoam-require]
will be insufficient.

This is most notably the case for ParaView and/or QT compilation.
As duly noted in [BUILD][link third-build] and [README][link third-readme] and information,
building ParaView from source tends to be the most difficult part of
any third-party compilation.

For general functionality, the paraview version distributed with
the operating system or a [binary package][download ParaView]
may be sufficient for your needs.


**Please help us with keeping the information here up-to-date and accurate.**
